# Rails API implementation demo

An in-progress implementation of a RESTful API using Rails.

### Objectives

- Use an API-only implementation Rails with no front-end view scaffolding

- Use [Apipie](https://github.com/Apipie/apipie-rails) to create Swagger-style endpoint docs.

- Match the schema for my [React Portfolio](https://github.com/garyesmith/react-portfolio) app with an eye to eventually integrate the two.

- Implement token authentication.
